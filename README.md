# calendAR
React-native socail/smart Calendar App


**Getting Started:**
1. Make sure React-Native is properly installed on your machine, run "react-native init test_project", start an emulator and see if it works, if so, clone repo and continue.

2. I used visual studios code, if you want to use a different text editor, you must figure out the linter.
  -For Vis Code, download the extention "eslint". Then in your project directory, type: "npm install --save-dev eslint-config --rallycoding". This will allow the editor to give your styling guides for react-native

3. We are going to use "native-base" which has a bunch of templated compenent for us to use to create the visuals, there is an example usage currently on the app. To install run " npm install native-base --save", then "react-native link"

4. You should now be able to run the project with ios or android.

**Dependiencies List**
1. Native-base : Used for templating, has a bunch of useful components.
2. Wix : React-native-calendars : $ npm install --save react-native-calendars
3. Firebase: npm install --save firebase
4. React-native-router flux: npm install --save react-native-router-flux


**Future**
1. Wix : React-native-navtigation- useful for navigating differnet views.
